### Please take the End-Course Instructional Staff Survey if You Haven't Yet

Trilogy, as a company, values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It’s hard for us to understand what these areas are unless we’re asking questions. Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are key members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we would appreciate your feedback at the following link if you have not already taken the end-course survey:
